The government is based on a council composed by the leaders of the main religions of the city. It is well known that the biggest influence is given by the `Church of Pelor`, the biggest cult of the city, followed by the `Church of Heironeus`. Different hidden cults like `The Hand of Secret` or `Forbidden Roles` are also present inside the city, but they are forbidden, so the application of those cults are punished by the law.

## The Church of Pelor

The biggest cult of the city, leaded by `Priestess Agatha`, who rarely make public apparitions. It is historically the cult who founded the city of `Nebury` and established a dominance on the council of the city.

## The Church of Heironeus

The second biggest cult, known to have the best fighters and protectors of the city. It is known that the cult made a pact with the `Church of Pelor` in order to end a `civil war` happened 40 years ago against the two cults, both cults, indeed, share the same duty of `Justice` and `Light`
