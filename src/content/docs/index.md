title: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight
---

This is the main story of a campaign based on “The Wild Beyond the Witchlight”. Everything starts when Alcide, well known noble of a village named Blore, decides to group workers to drain the lake in front of a tower owned by his family for generations. This lake contains ancient ruins in the middle, and has a legend around it that tells about the location of magic relics in the depths of the lake.

When all the workers are grouped together, they start to feel more and more tired every morning. Is when the characters are tasked with harvesting wood that (when returned back) they see all the other workers, dancing together with fairies flying around them. Workers seemed to be asleep, under some kind of curse.

It is when the characters notice other workers disappearing that they start to get scared, but Alcide doesn’t seem interested, he pushes other workers to keep working without investigating further. At some point the characters will understand that the noble is involved with the disappearances and will decide to kill Alcide, to run away or to fight the fairies.
