`Class: Rogue 1` `Race: Variant Human` `Alignment: Neutral Good`

`Gender: Female` `Age: 24` `Height: 1.65` `Eyes: Red` `Skin: White` `Hair: Brown`

Esika is a 18 years old female Human who comes from a city far from [Blore](/places/blore), named [Horon](/places/horon). She is searching for her sibling named `Arika` who disappeared in the `Witchlight Carnival` 8 years ago.

She tells everyone that the reason she is going to work for [Alcide](/npc/alcide) is that she needs money to stay in the carnival to find her brother. The real reason is that she wants to steal the relic if there is the possibility, then run away, joining the `Witchlight Carnival`, to find `Arika` and have a safe place to be after the steal.

The relationship with `Arika` is very strong, they grew up together with the help of the citizens of [Horon](/places/horon), or stealing from local shops, after they got abandoned by their parents after being born. The reason her parents abandoned them is not known, but they had a hard time in the orphanage where they lived for around 11 years, but she’ll never talk about it during the story.
