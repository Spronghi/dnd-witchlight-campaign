## Kalim

Kalim is a friendly guy, usually helpful with other workers. He is there because he has a family and he needs money to build a house. He will notice something weird the second day and will tell the group if they socialized enough with him.

## Foron

Foron doesn’t like to talk to other people. He won’t share any information because he doesn’t trust new joiners. He already worked with Kalim, so they know each other.

## Ketra

Ketra is a very strong girl who is traveling the world but now she needs money to get some food. She is there because the job is well paid and they provide food also.
