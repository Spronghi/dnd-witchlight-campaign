`600 people` `Mostly humans`

Blore is a small village known mostly because it is one of the places visited by the `Witchlight Carnival` for two days every `8 years` (it will take place around the `25th of September`). The village sustains itself mostly from agriculture and keeping, but, during the carnival, a lot of tents are constructed because of the visitors.

The population usually triple during the carnival, and you can find tents for around 10gp for two nights. The influence of the carnival is barely visible in terms of magic.

:::tip[Special infos]
While villagers earn a lot of money from the carnival, it is forbidden for the villagers to visit it, since, every time, weird things happen -- children missing, people having hallucinations for days, people abandoning the village, etc..

Villagers never talk to the visitors about these events, since it wonâ€™t help the tourism around it.

## The Belly Buster

This is the main tavern of the village where villagers come at the end of the working day.

The tavern looks pretty good from the outside, and is made from wood. There is a sign outside with the name of the tavern. The tavern is usually open all day but is busy from 4pm till 11pm.

`DC INT 10` Seems recently renovated, because the sign seems pretty new.

## Polso

Polso is owner of the `The Belly Buster` and is a friendly guy who seems quite happy about welcoming the party.

He has a quite visible belly with a big mustache. He knows that the previous guards are leaving the camp, but he doesn't know why.

He will mostly talk about:

- How nice [Alcide](/npc/alcide) is because he borrowed money from him to renew the tavern
- The `Witchlight Carnival` and the fact that a lot of people will come to his new tavern because of it (a room will cost **20gp** for two night starting from tomorrow, **2sp** tonight)
- The path to arrive on the lake, and, if asked, he will provide a map

## Toda

Toda owns the central market of Blore.

`TODO write something more about it`
