Blore is a village inhabited by around 600 people. It is known because it is one of the places visited by the `Witchlight Carnival` for two days every `8 years` (it will take place around the `25th of September`). The village sustains itself mostly from agriculture and breeding, but, during the carnival, a lot of tents are constructed because of the visitors. The population usually triple during the carnival, and you can find tents for around 10gp for two nights.

## Unknown infos

While villagers earn a lot of money from the carnival, it is forbidden for the villagers to visit it, since, every time, weird things happen (children missing, people having hallucinations for days, people abandoning the village, etc..). Villagers never talk to the visitors about these events, since it wonâ€™t help the tourism around it.
