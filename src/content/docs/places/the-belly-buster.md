The tavern looks pretty good from the outside, and is made from wood. There is a sign outside with the name of the tavern. The tavern is usually open all day but is busy from 4pm till 11pm.

`DC INT 10` Seems recently renovated, because the sign seems pretty new.

## Polso

Polso is owner of the tavern and is a friendly guy who seems quite happy about welcoming the party.

He has a quite visible belly with a big mustache. He knows that the previous guards are leaving the camp, but he doesn't know why.

He will mostly talk about:

- How nice [Alcide](/npc/alcide) is because he borrowed money from him to renew the tavern
- The `Witchlight Carnival` and the fact that a lot of people will come to his new tavern because of it (a room will cost **20gp** for two night starting from tomorrow, **2sp** tonight)
- The path to arrive on the lake, and, if asked, he will provide a map
