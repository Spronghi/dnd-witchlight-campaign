The tavern looks pretty good from the outside, and is made from wood. It seems recently renovated and there are around 20 people inside. The owner of the tavern is called Polso and is a friendly guy who seems quite happy about welcoming the party.

He will mostly talk about:

- How nice [Alcide](/npc/alcide) is because he borrowed money from him to renew the tavern
- The `Witchlight Carnival` and the fact that a lot of people will come to his new tavern because of it (a room will cost **20gp** for two night starting from tomorrow, **2sp** tonight)
- The path to arrive on the lake, and, if asked, he will provide a map
