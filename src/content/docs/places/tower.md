The tower is a medieval tower with four floors each two meters high.

- The ground floor contains the foods, water and wine for everyone.
- The first, second and third floors contain old beds for the workers to sleep (around 15 beds per floor), there are no windows and only three torches per floor.
- The last floor is used by Alcide, no workers are allowed inside.

The atmosphere is really creepy, the lake is surrounded by the same forest that releases a thick fog, indeed, the ancient ruins are barely visible from the tower.
