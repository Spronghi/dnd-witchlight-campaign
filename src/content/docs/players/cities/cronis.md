`150k people` `Mostly humans, elves and half-elves` `Main religion: Boccob`

![Cronis](/images/cronis.jpg)

`Cronis` is for sure not the biggest city in `Alcera`, but is the most evolved in terms of technologies. It is not a surprise to see workers that elevate huge bricks using telekinesis and people traveling using portals from one side of the city to the other. It is common understanding that the most knowledged and smart people of `Alcera` are born in `Cronis`.

Despite the advance setting of the city, the population is divided in hierarchies that contributes to certain social rules. The `Elves` are high in rank compared to the other races (since they founded the city) and the only who can access the parliament, followed by `Half-Elves` and `Humans`.

## Orania

`Orania` is known to be the biggest library in the world, where the knowledge of wars and heroes is stored and preserved. It is also known to be the place to go if an ancient spell is needed, this is also why is protected so carefully, only people with a special permit can enter.

## The School of Wonder

`The School of Wonder` is the place where the studies of `Cronis` develop the most. Every student has limited access to `Orania` and, based on the topic, they can visit different parts of the library. For outsiders, it is very hard to be accepted as a student in the school.
