`600 people` `Mostly humans`

Blore is a small village that sustains itself mostly from agriculture and subsistence farming. Villagers are mostly humans and is a place where travelers are well seen, especially if they spend money into taverns or buy foods from villagers.

## The Belly Buster

This is the main tavern of the village where villagers come at the end of the working day.

The tavern looks pretty good from the outside, and is made from wood. There is a sign outside with the name of the tavern. The tavern is usually open all day but is busy from 4pm till 11pm.
