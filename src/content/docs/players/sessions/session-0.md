The campaign setup is `mid magic`. There are people in villages that have never seen magic (or magical beasts) in their entire life, while there are cities who use the magic for different scopes and works in general.

The most common races are humans, dwarves, orcs and halflings.

The adventure take place because (for one reason or another) the characters decide to join a group of workers that need to drain a lake the `18th of September`, the group is supposed to meet there the night before.

The people of reference you have for the mission are [Alcide](/players/npc/alcide), since these materials are not easy to find, the group will also be tasked to defend the caravan during the travel.
