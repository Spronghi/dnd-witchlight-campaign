title: How to drain a lake
---

Designing and constructing a drainage system to dry up a lake in is a complex engineering endeavor. Here's a more detailed breakdown of how you can pursue this option:

1. **Survey and Planning**: Begin by surveying the lake and its surroundings. Understand the topography, water inflow sources (rivers, streams), and the lake's current drainage outlets. This information will be crucial for your plan.

2. **Engineering Team**: Assemble a team of skilled engineers and laborers who can assist in the project. These NPCs or party members will be responsible for the physical construction and maintenance of the drainage system.

3. **Resource Gathering**: Acquire the necessary resources for construction, such as wood, stone, metal, and other materials for building channels, pipes, and pumps. This might involve trade, mining, or negotiation with local suppliers.

4. **Design the System**: Work with your engineering team to design a system that efficiently diverts water from the lake. This could include digging canals, installing pipes, building sluice gates, and creating a pumping mechanism.

5. **Build Infrastructure**: Over time, begin constructing the drainage system. This could involve various stages, starting with the primary diversion channels leading away from the lake and then branching out into a network of smaller channels and pipes.

6. **Labor and Time**: Understand that this project will take time, possibly weeks or months of in-game time. You may need to overcome challenges like bad weather, sabotage, or monster attacks during construction.

7. **Maintain and Monitor**: Regularly inspect and maintain the drainage system to ensure it functions correctly. Be prepared to deal with issues like clogs, leaks, or breaches.

8. **Environmental Impact**: Consider the environmental consequences of your actions. Drying up a lake can have repercussions on the local ecosystem and might lead to conflict with nature-oriented NPCs or creatures.

9. **Collaboration and Challenges**: Along the way, your party might need to negotiate with local authorities, seek permissions from landowners, and deal with unforeseen obstacles or adversaries who don't want the lake to dry up.

10. **Completion**: Once the drainage system is fully operational and water levels in the lake start to decrease, be prepared for any unexpected consequences or challenges that arise as a result of your actions.
