The campaign setup is `mid magic`. There are people in villages that have never seen magic (or magical beasts) in their entire life, while there are cities who use the magic for different scopes and works in general.

The most common races are humans, dwarves, orcs and halflings.

The adventure take place because (for one reason or another) the characters decide to join a group of workers that need to [drain a lake](/procedures/drain-a-lake) near a isolated [tower](/places/tower) owned by a noble named [Alcide](/npc/alcide). The caravan will start from a tavern called [The Belly Buster](/places/blore/#the-belly-buster) placed in [Blore](/places/blore) the `18th of September`, the group is supposed to meet there the night before.

The people of reference you have for the mission are [Alcide](/npc/alcide) and [Toda](/places/blore#toda). The tower is `two weeks` of travel from [Blore](/places/blore). The caravan will mostly transport food, wine, wood, stone, metal, and other materials for building channels, pipes, and pumps. Some of the materials were traded with local suppliers by [Toda](/places/blore#toda), since these materials are not easy to find, the group will also be tasked to defend the caravan during the travel.

## Known infos

Blore is a small village that sustains itself mostly from agriculture and keeping. Villagers are mostly humans and is a place where travelers are well seen, especially if they spend money into taverns or buy foods from villagers.
