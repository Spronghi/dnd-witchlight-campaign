title: Session 1

It is Sunday, `17th of September`, the characters were told to meet in a tavern named [The Belly Buster](/places/blore/#the-belly-buster) in [Blore](/places/blore).

At the entrance there will be [Polso](/places/blore/#the-belly-buster#polso) waiting to welcome the group inside the tavern.

`Polso and tavern description`

During the conversation [Esika](/npc/esika) will enter the tavern and [Polso](/places/blore/#the-belly-buster#polso) will tell the group that she will join them during the trip. He will task them from [Alcide](/npc/alcide) with transporting wood from the village to the lake as a protection for the other workers.

If the party approach [Esika](/npc/esika), she will tell them regarding:

- The legend around ancient ruins in the lake
- Her reason to take the job (only if really pushed she will tell that she wants to steal the ancient relic inside the lake) `DC 18 INT` to understand she is laying
- General information about the `Witchlight Carnival`
- The fact that [Alcide](/npc/alcide) will gift two free nights in the tents for the `Witchlight Carnival` to the best five workers

## Travel to the lake

The driver of the caravan is [Sittas](/npc/workers#sittas).

`TODO add infos for the trip`

While getting closer to the tower, the characters notice that the atmosphere is getting creepier and creepier. Following the path becomes more difficult since a thick fog comes out of the forest that surrounds the path closely. At some point they get attacked by spiders and other creatures.

`TODO decide the fight`

## The lake and the tower

The group arrives at [the tower](/places/tower) around `8pm`.

They find almost 35 [workers](/npc/workers) having lunch together, that’s where [Alcide](/npc/alcide) approaches the group asking them to rest because the next day, the characters will join the other [workers](/npc/workers) to [drain the lake](/procedures/drain-a-lake). Seems like the other [workers](/npc/workers) started to work one day ago, most of the people are there because of the money, and don’t seem to be too much interested in having conversations.

## First morning in the camp

In the morning, the characters start to contribute and so on for a couple of days, but every day the group seems to wake up more tired than when they actually went to sleep.
