title: Session 1
description: Party will meetup and travel to the lake 
---

It is Sunday, `17th of September`, the characters were told to meet in a tavern named [The Belly Buster](/places/the-belly-buster) in [Blore](/places/blore), where they will be tasked by the owner with transporting wood from the village to the lake as the last workers joining the group.

The characters will be traveling together for one day to the tower with [Esika](/npc/esika), who is sitting inside the tavern and drinking alone on a table. If the party approach her, she will tell them regarding:

- The legend around ancient ruins in the lake
- Her reason to take the job (only if really pushed she will tell that she wants to steal the ancient relic inside the lake)
- General information about the `Witchlight Carnival`
- The fact that [Alcide](/npc/alcide) will gift two free nights in the tents for the `Witchlight Carnival` to the best five workers

## Travel to the lake

While getting close to the tower, the characters notice that the atmosphere is getting creepier and creepier. Following the path becomes more difficult since a thick fog comes out of the forest that surrounds the path closely. At some point they get attacked by spiders and other creatures.

`TODO decide the fight`

## The lake and the tower in front of the lake

The group arrives at the tower around `8pm`.

The tower is a medieval tower with four floors each two meters high. The ground floor contains the foods, water and wine for everyone. The first, second and third floors contain old beds for the [workers](/npc/workers) to sleep (around 15 beds per floor), there are no windows and only three torches per floor. The last floor is used by [Alcide](/npc/alcide), no [workers](/npc/workers) are allowed inside. Like during the path, the atmosphere is really creepy, the lake is surrounded by the same forest that releases a thick fog, indeed, the ancient ruins are barely visible from the tower.

They find almost 35 [workers](/npc/workers) having lunch together, that’s where [Alcide](/npc/alcide) approaches the group asking them to rest because the next day, the characters will join the other [workers](/npc/workers) to drain the lake. Seems like the other [workers](/npc/workers) started to work one day ago, most of the people are there because of the money, and don’t seem to be too much interested in having conversations.

## First morning in the camp

In the morning, the characters start to contribute and so on for a couple of days, but every day the group seems to wake up more tired than when they actually went to sleep.
