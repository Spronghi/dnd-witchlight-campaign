title: Adventure Setup
description: Setup description for the adventure
---

The campaign setup is `mid magic`. There are people in villages that have never seen magic (or magical beasts) in their entire life, while there are cities who use the magic for different scopes and works in general.

## Geography

There are three continents: `Alcera`, `Torin` and `Lorca`. The campaign will take place in the continent of `Alcera`.

The continent of `Alcera` is fragmented in various cities of different sizes that I am not going to list here. The biggest one are [Nebury](/cities/nebury), [Cronis](/cities/cronis) and [Phera](/cities/phera). The most common races are `humans`, `dwarves`, `orcs` and `halflings`.

## Cults

The main cults are divided in different factions that collaborate or not based on their duty.

There are also minor cults based on races and cities.
